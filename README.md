## Installation

To get started with the Battleship game, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

  bash
  git clone https://github.com/ayuboketch/battleship.git
  cd battleship
  npm install or npm i

Usage

To run the game locally:

bash

  npm start

This will start a local development server, and you can play the game by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
Multiplayer Mode

To enable multiplayer mode, you need to run a server that supports WebSockets. This project includes a basic Node.js server for that purpose.

    Start the server:

    bash

    npm run server

    Open http://localhost:3000 in two different browser windows to play against yourself or share the link with a friend.

Testing

This project uses Vitest for testing. To run the tests, use:

bash

  - npm test

This will execute the test suite and provide coverage information.
